- Standard MCP client library support
- Custom client integration examples
- Web application integration patterns

### Quality Assurance

#### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Comprehensive linting configuration
- Automated formatting with consistent style
- Pre-commit hooks for quality enforcement

#### Testing Strategy

### Known limitations

#### Current constraints
- Single server instance per process
- File-based input/output (no streaming yet)
- Limited to HED JavaScript validator capabilities
- Requires Node.js 22+ runtime environment

#### Future enhancements
- Streaming support for large files
- Multi-threaded validation processing
- Additional output formats (XML, CSV)
- Real-time validation WebSocket support

### Migration notes

This is the initial release, so no migration is required. Future releases will include migration guides as needed.

### Breaking changes

None in this initial release.

### Security

#### Security measures
- Input validation for all parameters
- Safe file system operations
- No arbitrary code execution
- Secure JSON parsing

#### Recommendations
- Run server in isolated environment for production use
- Implement proper access controls for file system access
- Regular dependency updates for security patches
- Monitor resource usage in production deployments

### Performance

#### Benchmarks
- Schema loading: ~500ms (cached: ~10ms)
- String validation: ~1-5ms per string
- TSV file validation: ~50-200ms per file (depending on size)
- Memory usage: ~50-100MB base + schema cache

#### Optimization tips
- Reuse server connections for batch operations
- Cache schemas between validations
- Use inline data for small datasets
- Disable warnings for production validation
